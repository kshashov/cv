## Summary
Senior Java developer with 5+ years of commercial experience. I try to follow development trends and often learn new languages and technologies. In addition to Java backed development I had experience in native Android, cross-platform development on Flutter, backend .Net/.Net Core development, and frontend development on VueJS. At the moment, I am interested in Java/Kotlin development, but I am ready to consider full stack development in case of interesting offer. 

In the last year, in addition to development, I have led a small team of two Java developers, front-end developer and QA. We had English-speaking customers so all technical discussions were on English (speaking at standups and writing in Jira/emails).

In my free time I play computer games, improve my knowledge in English, study the piano from scratch.

## Projects
Unfortunately, my commercial experience has nothing to do with open source, so I can only share my [home projects](/projects.md) created while studying some technologies.
