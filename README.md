## Summary
Highly  motivated  and  enthusiastic  Senior  Software  Development  Engineer  with  more  than  6  years  of software engineering experience in the development of entire web apps and back-end services. I try to follow development trends and often learn new languages and technologies. In addition to Java backed development I had experience in native Android, cross-platform development on Flutter, backend .Net/.Net Core development, and frontend development on VueJS. At the moment, I am interested mostly in Java/Kotlin development, but I am ready to consider full stack development in case of interesting offer. 

In the last year, in addition to development, I have led team of 6 people (4 Java developers, front-end developer and QA).

In my free time I play computer games, improve my knowledge in English, study the piano from scratch.

## Projects
Unfortunately, my commercial experience has nothing to do with open source, so I can only share my [pet projects](/projects.md) created while studying some technologies.
